Title: Building trading strategy with pine script 

Aim: The project aimed to provide hands-on experience in developing custom trading strategies using Pine Script language on TradingView. Pine Script is a programming language that allows traders to create custom indicators and strategies on the TradingView platform. 

Motivation: The project entailed getting an understanding of how the trading view platform works, how to read charts, using indicators, available functionalities and the final boss i.e.learning pine script to develop a comprehensive trading strategy and backtest it to see how it performs. My motivation for the project was to study if the indicators work the way we intend them to, add a little bit of coding to my arsenal and have a productive summers.

Description: I started with exploring the platform and pine script, read a bunch of articles, got my hands on some frisky shortcuts, some websites that i referred to can be found here: 
[Quantifiedstrategies](https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/trading-strategies/)
[Algotrading101](https://algotrading101.com/learn/pine-script-tradingview-guide/#:~:text=Pine%20script%20was%20designed%20to,up%20quickly%20and%20notice%20similarities.)
[Tradingcode](https://www.tradingcode.net/tradingview-pine-script-course/)
And a bunch of youtube tutorials are also helpful 

Also fun fact, you can use indicators on other indicators to produce results in trading view
Then I read about a bunch of indicators, it was a smooth ride as i had already done a little paper trading and portfolio building before. 
And explored strategies that supposedly produced good profit ex 50 day SMA, donchian channel breakouts etc links to which i have attached below:

// https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-technical-analysis-strategies-that-help-confirm-winning-trades
// Babypips

Finally read how to implement these strategies using pine script, backtest them to generate orders etc etc, links to those articles are also attached below 
// https://www.tradingcode.net/tradingview/example-strategies/
// trading view itself also has a good repository of pine scripts for indicators and strategies 

After a comprehensive study i build a VWAP and SWMA strategy, it was a trend confirming long term strategy; vwap stands for volume weighted average price, its a volume indicator whereas swma is smooth weighted moving average 


One problem that i came accross was lot of articles on internet uses pine script version 4 but the current one is version 5 so you might have to modify it at times
